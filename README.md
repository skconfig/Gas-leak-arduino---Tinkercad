# Gas leak arduino - Tinkercad

## Overview
This project simulates a gas leakage detection system using Tinkercad, Arduino, a gas sensor, a red LED, and a buzzer. The system monitors the sensor value and activates the alarm (LED and buzzer) when the value exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Hardware Components
* Arduino Uno R3
* Red LED
* Buzzer
* Gas sensor
* Resistor 330 Ω
* Resistor 4 700 Ω

## Software
* Tinkercad
* Arduino IDE

## Usage
1. Connect the hardware components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Open the serial monitor to view sensor values.
4. Simulate gas leakage by increasing the sensor value (e.g., by adjusting the simulated gas sensor in Tinkercad).
5. The system will activate the alarm (LED and buzzer) when the sensor value exceeds the threshold.
